# 🧮 Loan Calculator & Analysis
## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates practical financial analysis using Excel — showing the complete journey of a loan from start to finish.
It’s a valuable example of data-driven decision-making in personal finance, lending, and credit management contexts.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an automated Excel model for loan repayment tracking.
- Analyze how payment structure changes across the loan period.
- Calculate total interest paid and visualize cumulative progress.
- Strengthen financial modeling and data visualization skills using Excel.
- Support better financial decision-making through clear insights.
  
## 📊 Questions Answered:
1. How much total interest will be paid over the lifetime of the loan?
2. How long does it take before the majority of each payment goes toward principal rather than interest?
3. How does changing the payment frequency (e.g., monthly vs. biweekly) affect total interest paid?
4. How does the loan term (years) affect total repayment cost?
5. What is the cumulative principal and interest paid after one year?
